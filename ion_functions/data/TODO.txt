This is a list of tasks that need action here in ion_functions, but are
waiting for resolution of paired tasks elsewhere in ION.


1. Change the wrapper functions in vel_functions to use actual depth of
    instrument and not z=0 (sea level)
    * waiting on the ability for the depth of an instrument to get put
        into a coverage, probably by lookup value (for instruments that
        do not report it).

2. Add unit tests for vel_functions.
    * waiting on project scientists to create test values.  The DPS had
        no test values listed.

3. Add unit tests for do2_functions.
    * waiting on project scientists to create test values that work.
        The DPS had values that were off, even when using the provided
        Matlab code.

4. Need to add an interpolation function (maybe) to do2_functions to be
    be able to interpolate CTD records to DOSTA time stamp.
    * waiting on the ability to grab collocated CTD values from a
        complex coverage (multiple for interpolation).  This is more
        relevant to the parameter functions in preload though.
